            <h2 class="wellnessbox2-head">SLEEP</h2>
            <p class="wellness2-para"> Having a good work-life balance can be hard. Working 40 hours week, making time for family and friends and of course your personal interests while getting the required 8 hours of sleep each night seems unattainable. But you should ensure you get the required amount of sleep as its essential for staying healthy. One benefit of sleep is that it helps you think more clearly and focus during the day whether at work or at school.</p>

            <p class="wellness2-para">Lifestyle diseases such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension can be prevented by maintaining a good diet. The onus is on you take good care of yourself as living with these diseases can be cumbersome. These diseases will damage your vital organs and cause your function not to function properly. Having diabetes and hypertension means having a restrictive diet so as to bring these diseases under control so its imperative that you watch what you eat.</p>

        <div class="workout">
            <h2 class="wellnessbox2-head">WORKING OUT</h2>
            <p class="wellness2-para">Working out whether yoga, dance, going to the gym, hiking etc. is important for good health. Working out can be fun and doesn't have to be strenous activities in the gym. I personally prefer dancing and going hiking and exploring nature. It is also very inexpensive to work out as it does not require equipment. Get active even if it's only 20 minutes per day. Choose a time that is convenient for you and do it! </p>

            <h1>JUICING</h1>
            <p class="juicing-para">Besides eating healthy, agreat way to take care of yourself is juicing.You can juice your favourite fruits and vegetables. Some don't like the taste of green juice but the right amount of each fruit and vegetable can make it taste like your favourite juice.  One ingredient I think everyone should put in their juice is ginger. Ginger makes your juice taste way better and have great anti-inflammatory properties. You can also add coconut water and pineapples as these help with making your juice taste better. Also add vegetables filled with minerals and vitamins such as celery, spinach and kale.</p>

        <p>Bringing a life into this world can be one of the most rewarding experiences life has to offer. But you should ensure you take care of yourself and in turn your baby, whether in the womb or out the womb. While pregnant you may have cravings you can't control but it is all about balance. You should ensure you take your prenatal vitamins as prescribed by your doctor and eat from all food groups. You should also workout as this helps with labour. Sleeping and pregnancy are almost synonymous with each other. It is okay, get as much sleep as you can because sleepless nights are fast-approaching!</p>
