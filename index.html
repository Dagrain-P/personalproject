        <div class="meaning1">
            <h2 class="bbwhead">Beautiful</h2>
            <p class="bbwpara">Being beautiful is not just what is on the outside. Taking care of yourself can be quite rewarding. From eating healthy,working out and meditating it requires effort and consistency. A beautiful mind is important for outward beauty. Being beautiful means you exude confidence and have great aura. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="meaning2">
            <h2 class="bbwhead">Black</h2>
            <p class="bbwpara">Being black means loving the skin you were born in. Embracing your hair, hips, curves and honring your ancestors. It is important for black people to familiarize themself with the past and use it as a guide. Know why our culture is so unique.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="meaning3">
            <h2 class="bbwhead">Woman</h2>
            <p class="bbwpara">Women often don't have access to same resources and given the same opprtunities as men. But with perseverance many women have achieved the unthinkable and so can you! Be empowered to achieve all your dreams and break barriers. You are a queen and can achieve success too.</p>

            <h2>KANYE is a MAD MAN</h2>
            <p>The once beloved rapper Kanye West has lost his mind!! Kanye's latest antics are the flagrant remarks he made on the popular podcast 'Drink Champs' hosted by fellow rapper N.O.R.E. about George Floyd who was brutally murdered by policemen in May 2020. Kanye has been pushing this ant-black agenda and making derogatory statements about black people yet he still gets support from black people.</p>
                <p> I urge all black women to be intentional with their purchases, support those who support you. Support black businesses not the businesses of those who are trans-black.</p>
